# OCI Landing Zones Exadata Module
![Landing_Zone_Logo](./landing_zone_300.png)

This repository contains Terraform OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) modules for Exadata related resources that help customers deploy and manage Exadata infrastructure on OCI.

The following resources are available:

Exadata Infrastructure
VM Clusters
Database
Database Home
Pluggable Database

This module supports being passed an object containing references to OCIDs (Oracle Cloud IDs) that they may depend on. Every input attribute that expects an OCID (typically, attribute names ending in _id or _ids) can be given either a literal OCID or a reference (a key) to the OCID. While these OCIDs can be literally obtained from their sources and pasted when setting the modules input attributes, a superior approach is automatically consuming the outputs of producing modules. For instance, the Exadata Infrastructure module may depend on compartments and networks for deployment. It can be passed a compartments_dependency map and a network_dependency map with objects representing compartments and networks produced by other modules. The external dependency approach helps with the creation of loosely coupled Terraform configurations with clearly defined dependencies between them, avoiding copying and pasting OCIDs.

## Module Inputs

## OCI Landing Zones Modules Collection
This repository is part of a broader collection of repositories containing modules that help customers deploy and manage various OCI resources:

- [Exadata - current repository](https://github.com/)
- [Identity & Access Management](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam) - current repository
- [Networking](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-networking)
- [Governance](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-governance)
- [Security](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-security)
- [Observability & Monitoring](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-observability)
- [Secure Workloads](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-secure-workloads)

The modules in this collection are designed for flexibility, are straightforward to use, and follow best practices.

Using these modules does not require a user extensive knowledge of Terraform or OCI resource types usage. Users declare a JSON object describing the OCI resources according to each moduleâ€™s specification and minimal Terraform code to invoke the modules. The modules generate outputs that can be consumed by other modules as inputs, allowing for the creation of independently managed operational stacks to automate your entire OCI infrastructure.
