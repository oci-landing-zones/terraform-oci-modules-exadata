## <a name="overview">Overview</a>
This repository contains Terraform OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) modules for resources that help customers deploy and manage Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure on OCI.

The following resources are available:

- Exadata Infrastructure
- VM Clusters
- Database Home
- Container Database
- Pluggable Database

This module supports being passed an object containing references to OCIDs (Oracle Cloud IDs) that they may depend on. Every input attribute that expects an OCID (typically, attribute names ending in _id or _ids) can be given either a literal OCID or a reference (a key) to the OCID. While these OCIDs can be literally obtained from their sources and pasted when setting the modules input attributes, a superior approach is automatically consuming the outputs of producing modules. For instance, the Exadata Infrastructure module may depend on compartments and networks for deployment. It can be passed a compartments_dependency map and a network_dependency map with objects representing compartments and networks produced by other modules. The external dependency approach helps with the creation of loosely coupled Terraform configurations with clearly defined dependencies between them, avoiding copying and pasting OCIDs.

## <a name="Pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</a>

Before deploying the Exadata Cloud Infrastructure, VM Cluster, Database Home, Database, and PDB resources, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- [**IAM Policies**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/exadatacloud/doc/ecs-policy-details.html)  
  Ensure you have access to an active OCI Tenancy with sufficient permissions to create networking and database resources.

- [**Create RSA keys**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/dev/terraform/tutorials/tf-provider.htm#prepare)  
  Follow [this guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/dev/terraform/tutorials/tf-provider.htm#prepare) to Create RSA keys.

- [**Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/create_vcn.htm#top)  
  A VCN must be created in the target region where the Exadata Infrastructure will reside. 
  You can create the VCN and associated subnets in one of the following ways:

  1. **Using the OCI Core Landing Zone Template**  
     Visit the [OCI Core Landing Zone GitHub repository](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/terraform-oci-core-landingzone/tree/main/templates/standalone-three-tier-vcn-custom).  
     - Scroll down to the **“Deploy to Oracle Cloud”** section.  
     - Click **Deploy to Oracle Cloud** to launch Resource Manager (RMS).  
     - In the RMS stack, select **Exadata VCN** to deploy the VCN configuration suitable for Exadata environments.

  2. **Using the OCI Console**  
     Follow the [VCN creation guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/create_vcn.htm#top) to manually create the network components.

- [**Subnets**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/create_subnet.htm#top)  
  You must have at least two subnets available for Exadata infrastructure and VM clusters:
  - **Client Subnet:** For database client connections  
  - **Backup Subnet:** For Object Storage and backup operations  

  Subnets can be:
  - Private (recommended for Exadata)  
  - Created in the same Availability Domain as the Exadata infrastructure  

  Each subnet must have:
  - A valid Route Table  
  - Security Lists or Network Security Groups (NSGs) configured for required ingress/egress

- [**Route Tables and Gateways**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm)  
  Ensure that the subnet attached to the Exadata infrastructure can reach OCI Object Storage, required for backups and wallet access.  

  You can configure this using either:
  - [A **Service Gateway**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/servicegateway.htm) — for private subnet access to Object Storage, or  
  - [An **Internet Gateway**](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIGs.htm) — if using a public subnet.

## <a name="modules-collection">OCI Landing Zones Modules Collection</a>
This repository is part of a broader collection of repositories containing modules that help customers deploy and manage various OCI resources:

- [Exadata](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/terraform-oci-modules-exadata) - current repository
- [Identity & Access Management](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam)
- [Networking](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-networking)
- [Governance](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-governance)
- [Security](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-security)
- [Observability & Monitoring](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-observability)
- [Secure Workloads](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-secure-workloads)

The modules in this collection are designed for flexibility, are straightforward to use, and follow best practices.

Using these modules does not require a user extensive knowledge of Terraform or OCI resource types usage. Users declare a JSON object describing the OCI resources according to each module’s specification and minimal Terraform code to invoke the modules. The modules generate outputs that can be consumed by other modules as inputs, allowing for the creation of independently managed operational stacks to automate your entire OCI infrastructure.

## <a name="known-issues">Known Issues</a>
1.  The PDB creation might fail if the DB creation is in progress. solution: run "terraform apply" again and it will resume from where it left off.
2. When creating multiple Database Homes. in the same VM Cluster, this error may occur. "The operation cannot be performed because the Db System with ID ocid1... is in the UPDATING state." solution: run "terraform apply" again and it will resume from where it left off.
3. Each resource may take several hours to provision, so the terraform apply session may last 10+ hours. If terraform apply gets interrupted due to VPN disconnecting or other issues, run "terraform apply" again and it will resume from where it left off.
